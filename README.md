# Hi Availity Crew!

This is a very simple React form to collect and validate provider information. I used reactstrap for the ui elements and formik for the simple form validation. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
